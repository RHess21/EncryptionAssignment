For this assignment I decided to make it super simple and just do the encryption as needed. I used the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard).
This algorithm is Symmetrical, and uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data as you wish.
For this I am using the Secrets library to generate a new key every time the program is run.
The key is always a random value of bytes. 
I am .gitignoring the file in which i generate this key so to avoid any unseen vulnerabilty.
I can add a lot to this project to upgrade what it can do and the type of data it could take.
